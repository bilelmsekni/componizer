Componizer is a tool to help you refactor your Angular components. It's powered by two parts:
- Extension: VS Code extension for interaction with VS Code editor
- Schematics: Your logic to refactor components

Componizer has an immense potential and we are looking for active contributors. Contact me on bilel@krafted.tech
